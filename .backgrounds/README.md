These are some desktop background images I've accumulated over the years.

In general they aren't my work, but are freely available on the Internet. Some
of them have unknown or dubious licensing. If you think your image should not
be here, message me on Github or email dan@dulaney.xyz.

  Created by PopArt Studio in Serbia, and originally published by Smashing Magazine
  in their [2017 July wallpaper article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/desktop-wallpaper-calendars-july-2017/),
  This version turned up on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/7qbvkf)
  in January 2018 with the logo credits removed.

  Matches up nicely with a Solarized Dark theme.
